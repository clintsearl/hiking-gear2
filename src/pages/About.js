                             <p>First the technical details. I build this full stack app using React, and for the design I used a combination  of things. The Styled Components, Material Design Bootstrap, and the Add Gear form is regular Bootstrap. The back end is built with Express, the Node.js framework and it is RESTful. Both the React app and the Express API are hosted here on Heroku. As they are on the free plan and are set to fall asleep after so long, I’m glad you were patient with the loading. I added a loading message to the gear list page, which usually doesn’t take more than 15 seconds to load. However, occasionally the front end takes too long to load and Heroku sends up an error message! I am in the process of moving the front end to Netlify where it doesn’t fall asleep.</p>

                            <h3>On a less technical note</h3>
                                <p>This project is somewhat like my picture from a hike I took to dead horse lake in the Uintas. The path can be seen far below however, the trail to get to the bottom disappears in the steep mountain switchbacks. There’s a vision I have of the project including user logins, functionality to help packing, and trip planning resources. Like the trail, these features are what I see off in the distance. The switchbacks down the trail are all the things I am learning and experimenting with to get to the final vision. </p>

                            <dd><MDBIcon icon="code" className='p-2' />This will also be nessasary for when I want to send it out and let others have their own list as well.</dd>
                            <dd><MDBIcon icon="code" className='p-2' />However, currently it's convinent to let friends, family, and hiring managers checkout my work without creating their own account and data.</dd>

                                This button will help make a list of what you want to bring with you and see the total of what you want to take.

                                Save lists of what you took and name them. Then you can pull up lists for short hikes or long as well as summer or fall.
